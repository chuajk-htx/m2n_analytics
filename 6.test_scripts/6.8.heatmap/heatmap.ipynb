    "\n",
    "3. For the case of quality score, is there a relationship we can establish between enrolment and live to be \"combined\" into a single variable. Do we take the average or a weighted approach depending on their effects on quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Is there a trend between enrolment quality and live quality? Which one is usually higher than the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "4a. Following this, does it mean that the other one is the \"bottleneck\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is now that we are dealing with 3-dimensions where all 3 may have some form of relationship with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How do we deal with mated and non mated quality scores of the enrolled and live as compared to the matching scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. One of the more useful variables we can do is taking the Quality of probe divide by the Quality of the enrolled, this will give us a normalised value to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the important bias to take note is that we do not have all the photo attempts being done, this is because the photo od the day given to us are those that have passed the threshold, and the failed attempts were not stored into the system."
