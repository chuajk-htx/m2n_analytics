Short guide a docker

Docker image is just like a recipe, it containes the following:

Technologies that we need
Runtimes
Tools or instructions to run our code

Now we need something to actually run the code which is containers, this is like the actual meal which is what gets made from the recipe

With one image, we can make more containers, which makes it easier to run the code

Dockerfile is where we actually write our recipe

In contrast, dockercompose yaml tells us how we want to run the image that we created the docker image
